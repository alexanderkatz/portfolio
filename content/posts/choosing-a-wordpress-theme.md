This site and others that I have created are built on the WordPress platform. Often confused with WordPress.com’s blog hosting service, WordPress.org’s product is a blogging software and content management system. It is open source and awesome.

One of the first steps of making a WordPress site is to choose a theme. There are many search tools and guides to help choose a WordPress theme, but these often ignore one of the most important criteria, community. Whether you plan on modifying the them or not, it is important that the theme has active users. Users help discover bugs, guide theme development, and give tips on forums. Ideally the theme will be under active development so improvements can be incorporated into the code base.

Earlier this year I built a site for the Apollo Outreach, an organization that teaches kids how to make films. After preliminary design work was complete, I set out to find a theme with three qualities.

1. User Community
* Active Development
* Similarity to designer’s mockups

The theme I chose is called customizr and was created by Nicolas Guillaume. It is flexible and most importantly has a large user base and is under active development. One of the greatest things about customizr are the code snippets found on the website. Here, users and Nicolas have compiled code to help users get the most out of customizr. When I needed to change the location of the slider on the home page, I found a snippet that did just that.

The site was a big success and is now featured in the customizr showcase!

The designer I worked with is Jacob Gilbert. His work is awesome and you should check it out.
